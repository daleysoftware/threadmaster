threadmaster
============

Threadmaster is a simple, easy-to-use threading library for C++.

Threadmaster can be used to manage thread execution, thread locks, signals, thread delays and callback timers. It is a convenient wrapper for the standard pthread library that simplifies the creation of multi-threaded applications.
